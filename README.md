# .github

This is the special `.github` repository for the **SindarinSDK** organization on GitHub.

## What is a .github Repository?

The `.github` repository is a special repository that GitHub recognizes at the organization level. It serves several important purposes:

### Organization Profile README

The `profile/README.md` file in this repository is automatically displayed on the [SindarinSDK organization's profile page](https://github.com/SindarinSDK). This provides a welcoming introduction to visitors and helps them understand what the organization is about.

- **Public README**: Located at `profile/README.md` - visible to everyone visiting the organization page
- **Member-only README**: Can be placed in a separate `.github-private` repository for content only visible to organization members

### Community Health Files

This repository can also host default community health files that apply across all repositories in the organization:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Community code of conduct |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines |
| `FUNDING.yml` | Sponsorship information |
| `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` | Default issue templates |
| `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | Default PR template |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy |
| `SUPPORT.md` | Support resources |

These files serve as defaults for any repository in the organization that doesn't have its own version.
